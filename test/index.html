<section id="competencies">
<h4>Competencies<a class="headerlink" href="#competencies" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>In order to learn cybersecurity, a person must first know the basics of IT. This includes understanding how computers and networks work, as well as common security threats and how to protect against them. With this knowledge, a person can then begin to learn more specialized cybersecurity skills, such as penetration testing and incident response.</p>
<p>The minimum technical skills you must have to benefit from our platform include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Using command line utilities and tools</p></li>
<li><p>Operating virtual machines</p></li>
<li><p>Installing and managing software in virtual machines</p></li>
<li><p>Troubleshooting and resolving software errors</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="lab-environment">
<h4>Lab Environment<a class="headerlink" href="#lab-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>Our courses teach you how to setup and configure your own cybersecurity lab.</p>
<p>There are numerous advantages to creating your own cybersecurity lab rather than paying for one. The cost savings are perhaps the most evident benefit. When compared to the expense of licensing a pre-built lab, creating your own lab can save you thousands of dollars. You also have the option of customizing the lab environment to meet your specific requirements. You can, for example, select the hardware and software that will be used in your lab.</p>
<p>Another advantage of setting up your own cybersecurity lab is that it allows you to learn new skills. Building a lab from the ground up necessitates knowledge of networking, system administration, and other technical subjects. This experience is invaluable in your career as a cybersecurity professional.</p>
<p>We frequently see students who can complete a task in a pre-built lab but cannot complete the same task at work. This is because these labs are meant to lessen work complexity, thereby creating an illusion of personal capabilities. It’s also worth noting that you’ll be expected to set up your own lab to test tools and techniques in the workplace. Employers may give you the resources to set up virtual computers and networks, but it will be up to you to manage the lab environment and maintain your tools.</p>
<p>Finally, you should know that pre-built labs are not commonly licensed by top cybersecurity professionals. They’ve realized that setting up a lab is simple, efficient, adaptable, cost-effective, and that it sparks creativity. It also nullifies risk of performing unauthorized actions against systems provisioned by a third-party.</p>

    </td>
    <td style="border: none; text-align: left; padding: 10px; word-wrap: break-word;">
      Our catalogue comprises of 2,500 practical exercises across 22 I.T domains. On average, a course with us takes 600 hours of practical training to complete.

    <td style="border: none; text-align: left; padding: 10px; word-wrap: break-word;">
      MCSI's exercises are tasks that expert cybersecurity and I.T professionals have completed in the field.<br/><br/>Aside from a small minority of exercises, we provide no solutions and no walkthroughs. Users are expected to setup their own lab environment, configure all the tools, and produce deliverables identical to real-world engagements.

    </td>
    <td style="border: none; text-align: left; padding: 10px; word-wrap: break-word;">
      The price of a course with MCSI ranges from $99 to $1295 for 100 to 800 of hours of practical training.<br/><br/>Our courses have no time limit, no expiry date, no renewal fees. All future updates are also included in the price.<br/><br/>Imagine that you wanted to learn digital forensics. With SANS, you'd need to buy a 6-day course called FOR500 at $8,525 and then the cost of a single attempt at the exam will be $979. You'd also need to include any potential travel cost for classroom courses, the cost of buying beginner courses if you can't start straight with FOR500, and an ongoing certification renewal fee of $479.<br/><br/>In contrast, our MDFIR course is $595 for 600 hours of training, everything included. That includes having instructors available online to answer questions.<br/><br/>MCSI is 94% cheaper than SANS and offers 550 additional hours of training.

      People shouldn't pay for knowledge that's available for free on the Internet. That's why all our articles and videos have been released for free in our library.

    </td>
    <td style="border: none; text-align: left; padding: 10px; word-wrap: break-word;">
      Theoretical certificates and degrees have been refuted – they do not guarantee jobs for people. The reason is because employers are looking for employees with skills that solve problems worth paying for.<br/><br/>That's why MCSI offers users a revolutionary advantage: build your own portfolio that showcase your skills to employers.<br/><br/>With MCSI, every time you complete an exercise, you'll produce artefacts that demonstrate your competencies. These can be shown during an interview, and attached to your CV. This is how your portfolio is built and works for you.<br/><br/>We're proud to report that 100% of the users that completed our Remote Internship Program have landed jobs using the portfolio they built from doing our training.

<h4>Maintaining and Updating Courses<a class="headerlink" href="#maintaining-and-updating-courses" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>We have an enormous number of courses and exercises. Some of these exercises may become outdated with time. To address this issue, we’ve invented a proprietary technology that allows us to update an exercise in under 15 minutes. Users can also report bugs with exercises. Let us know if you think that an exercise doesn’t achieve its goal.</p>
<p>We ensure that our exercises are more up to date surpassing that of our competitors who need to update their lab environments, re-film courses, re-print booklets and so on.</p>
<p>In the past, we have not hesitated to rewrite entire courses based on the feedback and criticisms of users. If you’re right, and you’ve managed to convince us, then we’ll fix it, because our technology allows us to do so quickly.</p>

<h4>Writing to Us<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-to-us" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read our Path Forward Policy. If you want to submit a criticism or an enhancement, please do this in the following way:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Write an email to learn&#64;mosse-institute.com</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly identify whether your comment is a criticism or an enhancement.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the problem and explain how it prevents us from achieving our goals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Benjamin Mosse will personally read your message and respond to you. You should be aware that his standard response time may be up to two months for minor issues given his schedule. If the issue is serious, he will ask team members to investigate further and propose a solution that can be deployed quickly.</p>
<p>For any serious issue brought to our attention, it’s possible that we will engage in a conversation with you to get a better understanding. Do not get offended if your criticism isn’t immediately obvious to us – we may discuss your criticism at length in an effort to understand its value and make the necessary adjustments.</p>
<p>Finally, we may accept to fix something, but keep in mind that it may take us months to deploy a change in production. That’s because we have a very big software development roadmap, and not all ideas are a priority to us even if they are good ideas.</p>

<h3>Cloud Services<a class="headerlink" href="#cloud-services" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Cloud services are a type of internet-based computing that provide shared computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. They are sometimes referred to as “on-demand computing” or “utility computing”. Cloud services are a way to provide a more flexible and scalable approach to computing than traditional on-premises models. Cloud services are delivered through a network of data centers that are connected to each other through the internet. When a user needs computing resources, they can request them from a cloud service provider. The provider then allocates the resources from their pool of available resources and delivers them to the user over the internet.</p>

<h4>Terraform<a class="headerlink" href="#terraform" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. Infrastructure as code Infrastructure is composed of physical and virtual resources that can be provisioned, changed, and destroyed. Terraform abstracts away the details of the underlying infrastructure and allows Infrastructure as Code (IaC). With IaC, operators can manage infrastructure by writing code rather than manually configuring resources. Benefits of using Terraform There are many benefits of using Terraform to manage your infrastructure.</p>

<h4>Hypervisor Security<a class="headerlink" href="#hypervisor-security" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor, is a software program that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor allows multiple operating systems (OSes) to share a single physical host computer. Each virtual machine has its own virtual hardware, including a virtual CPU, memory, storage, and network adapters. Hypervisor security is a critical concern for organizations that use this technology. A hypervisor can be thought of as a mini operating system that controls access to physical resources. If a hypervisor is compromised, an attacker could gain access to all the virtual machines running on that host, as well as the host itself.</p>

<h4>Blockchain Security<a class="headerlink" href="#blockchain-security" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The security of blockchain technology is of paramount importance. The decentralized nature of the technology means that there is no central point of failure that could be exploited by malicious actors. Furthermore, the immutable nature of the blockchain means that once data has been recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted.</p>

<h4>Zero Trust<a class="headerlink" href="#zero-trust" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>Zero trust is a security model that requires strict verification of users before allowing them access to data or systems. In a zero trust security model, all users are treated as untrusted, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter. This approach is designed to address the shortcomings of the traditional security perimeter, which assumes that all users inside the perimeter are trustworthy and all users outside the perimeter are untrusted.</p>

<p>Windows forensics is the process of using investigative techniques to collect, analyze, and report data about a digital event that occurred on a computing device running the Microsoft Windows operating system. The data collected can be used to answer questions about what happened, when it happened, how it happened, and who was involved. Windows forensics is a specialized form of digital forensics that is designed to take advantage of the unique features and capabilities of the Windows operating system. Because of the way that Windows stores data and tracks activity, forensics investigators can use Windows forensics techniques to gain a more complete understanding of a digital event.</p>

<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">What is GRC?</p>
<p>Governance, risk and compliance (GRC) is a term that refers to the integrated approach an organization takes to managing its business processes, handling risk and ensuring compliance with regulations. By taking a GRC approach, organizations can improve their overall performance, better manage risk and protect themselves from potential regulatory penalties. An effective GRC strategy starts with a clear understanding of the organization’s business processes and the risks associated with them. Once these risks are identified, the organization can put in place controls to mitigate them. It’s important to involve all stakeholders in the GRC process, from the board of directors to front-line employees, so that everyone is aware of the risks and knows their role in mitigating them.</p>

<p>Search engines are a powerful tool for collecting OSINT (open-source intelligence). They can be used to find websites, document repositories, blogs, and other online resources that contain information that can be used for intelligence purposes. Search engines work by indexing the content of web pages and making that content searchable. When a user enters a query into a search engine, the search engine searches its index for web pages that contain the query terms and returns a list of those pages. The most popular search engines, such as Google and Bing, are commercial entities that make money by selling advertising. However, there are also many open-source and non-commercial search engines, such as DuckDuckGo and Yandex.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">What is Penetration Testing?</p>
<p>Penetration testing, also known as pen testing or ethical hacking, is the process of testing a computer system, network or web application to find security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. Penetration tests can be used to test both internal and external systems and can be conducted using a variety of methods, including manual testing, automated tools, or a combination of both. Penetration testing is an important part of any security program as it can help identify weaknesses in systems before attackers do. By conducting regular penetration tests, organizations can keep their systems secure and reduce the risk of being breached.</p>

One type of penetration testing is known as black box testing, which is where the tester has no knowledge of the system beforehand and attempts to find vulnerabilities through trial and error. Another type of penetration testing is known as white box testing, which is where the tester has full knowledge of the system and attempts to find vulnerabilities by looking for weaknesses in the system’s design. One of the most common penetration testing techniques is known as social engineering, which is where the tester tries to trick users into revealing sensitive information or granting access to the system.</p>

<h5>Brute Force Attacks<a class="headerlink" href="#brute-force-attacks" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>A brute force attack is a type of cyberattack where a hacker uses a automated tool to guess passwords or passphrases until they find the correct one. This type of attack is usually very time-consuming and can be very difficult to execute if the target has a long and complex password. However, if the hacker has a large enough list of common passwords, they may be able to successfully guess the correct one relatively quickly. Brute force attacks can be prevented by using strong and unique passwords, as well as by employing security measures such as rate-limiting or CAPTCHAs.</p>

<h4>Threat Modelling<a class="headerlink" href="#threat-modelling" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>Threat modeling is a process of identifying security threats and vulnerabilities in a system. It is a proactive approach to security that helps organizations to identify, assess and mitigate risks. Threat modeling can be used to identify threats and vulnerabilities in any system, whether it is a computer system, a network, an application, or even a physical facility. The process of threat modeling involves identifying the assets and data that are most important to protect, and then identifying the threats and vulnerabilities that could potentially compromise those assets and data. Once the threats and vulnerabilities have been identified, they can be mitigated or controlled through the implementation of security controls.</p>

<p>Critical reading is an active, discerning engagement with text. It demands that you not merely consume words but analyze, question, and judge them. This approach requires you to penetrate beyond the superficial, to assess the writer’s motives and the solidity of their arguments. As a critical reader, you engage in a dynamic interrogation of the text, forging connections to wider themes and applying your own knowledge to evaluate the veracity and implications of what is written. This skill is essential, not just for professional success, but for living as a fully aware, rational individual. Your mind is your primary weapon against mediocrity and falsehood; wield it with precision and purpose.</p>

<h4>Guiding Principles<a class="headerlink" href="#guiding-principles" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>When reading critically, it’s essential to adhere to guiding principles that ensure thorough understanding and objective evaluation of the text. We propose a total of 9 principles.</p>
<p>The first five principles are for engaging with ideas:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>All ideas are attempts to achieve a goal or solve a problem</p></li>
<li><p>Make an effort to engage with ideas that you disagree with</p></li>
<li><p>Even if you refute an idea, you have not necessarily refuted the problem it attempted to solve</p></li>
<li><p>If an idea that is falsifiable has not been refuted then it has merit</p></li>
<li><p>If you don’t like an idea that cannot be refuted, then either fix it or propose a better idea</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The remaining four principles are for debating ideas:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="6">
<li><p>Don’t quarrel, justify, attack, or try to prove; instead: understand, refute, fix and innovate</p></li>
<li><p>Have the courage to critique and be open to receiving criticism</p></li>
<li><p>Receiving criticism for your own ideas is the only way to know whether they are any good</p></li>
<li><p>Accept that it’s rational for another person to believe or prefer an idea that has not been refuted</p></li>
</ol>

<h5>Assume Errors<a class="headerlink" href="#assume-errors" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“In cybersecurity, we assume breach. In knowledge, we assume errors.” - Benjamin Mossé</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In the pursuit of knowledge, you must always remember that error is an inevitable companion to human endeavors. It is not enough to collect facts and build theories; you must also be vigilant, always prepared to challenge and revise your conclusions when faced with new arguments. Do not cling stubbornly to old beliefs if a new argument proves them inadequate. This intellectual flexibility is not a weakness but a sign of strength — a commitment to rationality and objectivity. Remember, it is through the rigorous questioning and testing of our ideas that we achieve clarity and understanding. You must never fear to acknowledge a mistake, for every error corrected is a step closer to the truth.</p>

<h5>How to Select a Text<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-select-a-text" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>In a world inundated with a deluge of information, not all ideas merit equal consideration or possess equivalent potency. It is crucial, therefore, that you exercise discernment in selecting what to read, where to invest your invaluable time and energy. Many are the hours, even lifetimes, squandered on studying theories long refuted or ideas devoid of the transformative power that marks truly great concepts. To derive the utmost value from your intellectual pursuits, you must focus on content that is not only credible and rigorously supported but also potent and applicable to real-life challenges. This methodical selection ensures that your intellectual endeavors are not merely academic exercises but are investments that yield concrete, beneficial results in reality. Choose wisely, for the mind is your most precious asset, and its nourishment should not be left to chance or swayed by the prevailing winds of mediocrity.</p>
<p>Ask yourself these three questions, and if the answer is YES to all of them, you’re all set:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Does the text address a current problem or topic that you are specifically interested in?</p></li>
<li><p>Do the ideas presented challenge or expand your existing knowledge in meaningful ways?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the text promote a deeper understanding or new ways of thinking that could influence your perspective or actions?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong></p>
<p><u>Can I just analyze a single chapters or a set of chapters rather than the whole book?</u></p>
<p>Yes. Focus on the areas you are most interested in and have fun with it.</p>
<p><u>Can I use Critical Reading for other texts than books?</u></p>
<p>Yes. You can analyze any text that interests you.</p>
<p><u>How do I know what to read?</u></p>
<p>Learn the most powerful ideas that humanity has discovered. Ideas that have created entire new fields, revolutionized old ones and propelled us forward.</p>
<p>Objectively, not all ideas are equal: some ideas are true, others are false, and some are better than others. If you’re not sure where to start, then start with ideas that are scientifically proven and have an impact on all aspects of life.</p>
<p>In cybersecurity, many books are outdated but not entirely irrelevant. In many cases, you are better off reading summaries of books published over 3 years ago and extracting the key ideas. Furthermore, many books focus specifically on one very technical area. Before buying them, we recommend that you analyze the Table of Content and read a free chapter or two online.</p>
<p><u>How can I be sure that I selected a good author?</u></p>
<p>Once you’ve decided on a topic to study, look into the various authors who have written about it. Choose the one you liked most and build from there.</p>

<h5>Technique 1.1: Deep Author Research<a class="headerlink" href="#technique-1-1-deep-author-research" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>After you’ve chosen an author, start gathering all of their written works, even if they don’t initially seem to be connected to a particular topic you’re interested in. Keep a copy of their articles, books, tweets, essays, and so on in a note-taking app. It’s worthwhile to invest one to three hours gathering all of this data because intellectuals frequently build their concepts over extended periods of time and through a variety of media.</p>

<section id="technique-1-3-context-recovery">
<h5>Technique 1.3: Context Recovery<a class="headerlink" href="#technique-1-3-context-recovery" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>To fully engage with a text, one must approach it not merely as an assortment of words, but as a concrete expression of values and ideas emanating from a specific mind. A text is an intellectual artifact borne out of distinct contexts—historical, cultural, philosophical, biographical, and technological—which are integral to its creation and must be understood to grasp its full meaning and intent.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Historical context</strong> anchors a text in time, linking it to the specific events and conditions that prevailed when it was created. It provides insight into the challenges and realities faced by the author, which invariably influence the themes and ideas explored in their work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cultural context</strong> embodies the prevailing norms, beliefs, and values of the society from which the text emerged. It shapes the way characters think, act, and interact, and colors the narrative with the societal expectations and taboos of that time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Philosophical context</strong> reveals the underlying ideas that drive the narrative. It is the framework within which the author’s thoughts are organized, presenting a particular view of man, society, and the universe. It influences how characters reason, the choices they make, and the consequences they face.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Biographical context</strong> provides insight into the author’s life and experiences, shedding light on their motivations and influences. It often reveals personal philosophies that permeate their work, offering a deeper understanding of their literary pursuits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technological context</strong> reflects the state of technology at the time of the text’s creation, which can fundamentally affect the setting and plot mechanisms. Understanding this helps in appreciating the limitations and possibilities faced by the characters and the author themselves.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, to neglect these contexts is to view a text in a vacuum — an egregious error for any serious thinker. A true understanding comes from integrating these aspects, thereby appreciating the work as a complete, rational product of a particular mind and era.</p>

<h5>How to Deobfuscate Text<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-deobfuscate-text" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Like malware code, text and meaning is frequently obfuscated too. You need tradecraft to recover the truth.” - Benjamin Mossé</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Some writers deliberately obfuscate the meaning of their text, employing a malicious technique designed to evade the scrutiny of critical thinking. This is an assault on reason, a deliberate muddying of clear waters with the intention of disarming the reader’s capacity to judge and evaluate. As a critical reader, it is imperative to cut through this fog with precision and assertiveness. Decipher the jargon that serves as a smokescreen for emptiness; cross-reference claims to expose falsehoods; rewrite complex sentences to unveil their true, often simplistic nature; and question the motivations behind the author’s words. Such vigilance is your duty in the battle against intellectual deceit, ensuring that clarity and truth prevail.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Identify Ambiguity:</strong> Look for words or phrases that are vague or whose meaning is not clear. Ambiguity can be a deliberate tactic to obscure the truth or to make statements less directly accountable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Detect Euphemisms:</strong> Notice when softer, more palatable words are used to disguise harsh realities or unpopular actions. Euphemisms may be used to manipulate sentiment or soften criticism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analyze Modality:</strong> Pay attention to the use of modal verbs (could, should, would, might) which can suggest possibilities rather than certainties, often used to make assertions less direct or definitive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluate Quantifiers:</strong> Pay attention to the use of quantifiers such as “all,” “every,” “none,” which can exaggerate or oversimplify claims and create misleading impressions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Look for Loaded Language:</strong> Identify emotionally charged words designed to elicit strong feelings. These can be used to sway opinions or distract from factual information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check for Overgeneralizations:</strong> Be wary of statements that make sweeping claims or generalizations without specific evidence. These can be a means to influence by overstating or oversimplifying the truth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spot False Dichotomies:</strong> Recognize when language is used to present only two extreme options, suggesting no possible alternatives. This technique forces an either/or decision, ignoring other viable options.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unpack Assumptions:</strong> Dig into the assumptions that underlie certain statements. Often, manipulative language rests on unspoken premises that, if examined, may not hold up.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cross-Verify Facts:</strong> Always check the factual basis of any statement. Manipulative language may distort or omit key facts, so verifying information through multiple reliable sources is crucial.</p></li>

<h5>How to Think Critically<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-think-critically" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>Here are critical questions to ask yourself whilst reading text:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>What is the main argument or thesis of the text?</strong> Identify the core message or claim the author is trying to convey.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What evidence does the author use to support their argument?</strong> Consider the type and quality of evidence presented. Is it factual, anecdotal, statistical, or theoretical?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What assumptions does the author make?</strong> Identify any underlying assumptions in the arguments. Are these assumptions reasonable or do they weaken the argument?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How does the author address counterarguments?</strong> Evaluate whether the author acknowledges and effectively counters opposing viewpoints, or if they ignore or dismiss significant alternative perspectives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is the argument logically coherent?</strong> Analyze the logical flow of the argument. Look for any fallacies or gaps in reasoning that might undermine the argument’s validity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What is left unsaid in the text?</strong> Think about what the author has omitted. Are there relevant facts or viewpoints that are not included that might change the interpretation of the argument?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How does the author use language to influence the reader?</strong> Analyze the use of rhetorical devices such as metaphors, similes, and analogies, or language techniques like emotive language, technical jargon, or formal/informal tone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What are the implications of the author’s conclusions?</strong> Think about the potential impact or consequences of the author’s arguments. What could happen if the author’s recommendations or conclusions are followed?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Does the text consider all relevant perspectives?</strong> Assess whether the text acknowledges all significant viewpoints regarding the issue it discusses. If not, what perspectives are missing, and how might this affect the argument?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What kind of reasoning does the author employ?</strong> Analyze whether the author uses deductive or inductive reasoning, and the effectiveness of these methods in supporting the text’s arguments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What emotional response does the text evoke?</strong> Reflect on your own emotional response to the text. Does the text seem designed to elicit a specific emotion? How might this influence the reader’s reception of the message?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What is the author’s purpose in writing the text?</strong> Try to discern why the author wrote the text. Was it to inform, persuade, entertain, or provoke thought? How successfully does the text achieve this purpose?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Does the text acknowledge its own limitations or potential biases?</strong> Consider whether the text self-reflects on its potential biases or the limitations of its arguments or perspectives, and how this affects its credibility or reliability.</p></li>

<h4>Phase 3: Critique Ideas<a class="headerlink" href="#phase-3-critique-ideas" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<section id="critical-fallibilism">
<h5>Critical Fallibilism<a class="headerlink" href="#critical-fallibilism" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>According to its website: “Critical Fallibilism (CF) is a rational philosophy created by Elliot Temple which explains how to evaluate ideas using decisive, critical arguments and accept only ideas with zero refutations (no known errors). An error is a reason an idea fails at a goal (in a context). CF explains why it’s a mistake to judge how good ideas are, how weighty evidence is or how strong arguments are, or to use credences or degrees of belief. We learn by an evolutionary process focused on error correction, not by induction or justification. CF offers an approach to thinking and decision making focused on qualitative differences not quantitative factors.” [1]</p>
<p>Here are some key characteristics of CF relevant to critical reading:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Binary Evaluation Focus:</strong> CF only uses binary (success or failure) outcomes and never grading or scaling the quality of ideas and arguments. This approach reduces ambiguity and simplifies evaluation processes​​. [2]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Error Correction Emphasis:</strong> CF views knowledge as error-corrected information, suggesting that traditional probabilistic beliefs (credences) often fail to address how beliefs should be systematically corrected in light of new evidence or better reasoning. [3]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contextual Knowledge:</strong> CF emphasizes that knowledge and error correction are contextual, meaning that evaluations of ideas should take into account the specific circumstances in which they are applied. This perspective helps avoid overly general or abstract judgments that might not hold in particular situations. [3]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decisive Criticism:</strong> CF introduces the concept of decisive criticism, which is central to its methodology. It stresses that criticism should be clear and decisive, aiming to either refute or not refute an idea directly. This is part of a broader critique against the common use of graded or scaled evaluations, which CF argues can lead to logical problems and ambiguities in how ideas are assessed​. [4]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoiding Overreach:</strong> CF warns against overreaching, or extending beyond one’s current capabilities or understanding, which can lead to errors or failures in reasoning. This is a critique of traditional approaches that may push for conclusions or decisions without adequate grounding or preparation​. [3]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Objective Reasoning:</strong> CF insists on objective reasoning, which should be persuasive to reasonable third parties, not just the individual making the argument. This promotes clarity and reduces personal biases in discussions and evaluations.​ [5]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Focus on Error Detection:</strong> A central tenet of CF is focusing intensely on detecting and correcting errors as a primary method of improving ideas and understanding, rather than merely accumulating new information.​ [5]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-compromising Solutions:</strong> In line with its binary evaluation system, CF advocates for solutions that do not involve compromises, suggesting that real solutions should completely resolve problems rather than merely finding a middle ground that may leave underlying issues unaddressed. [4]</p></li>

<h5>Technique 3.1: Yes or No Evaluations<a class="headerlink" href="#technique-3-1-yes-or-no-evaluations" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>In the previous phase, we collected all of the author’s ideas. Now, we process them one by one in accordance with CF’s Yes or No Evaluation:</p>
<a class="block grey-border mb-2"

                     alt="Yes or No Evaluations"/>
                </a><p>At the end of this process, you should have:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Refuted some ideas that were not achieving their intended goal</p></li>
<li><p>Accepted the ideas that have merit</p></li>
<li><p>Improved some ideas that had problems</p></li>
</ol>
<p>From the perspective of critical thinking and creativity, this exercise ought to have been invaluable. You were required to engage deeply with new ideas, to rigorously analyze and assess their merit. The process of challenging, refuting, accepting, and refining ideas should have sharpened your intellectual faculties. This is not merely an academic task; it is a fundamental practice of a rational mind striving to achieve clarity and certainty in its convictions.</p>
<p>Important clarification by Elliot Temple: “For inventing a new idea to solve a problem, after a refutation, a common issue people have is they don’t realize that variants or versions (small changes to existing ideas) count as new. They may only look for something brand new or very different.”. Hence, attempt to improve an idea even if it has been refuted because an adjustment could work.</p>

<section id="technique-3-2-template">
<h5>Technique 3.2: Template<a class="headerlink" href="#technique-3-2-template" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>You write a refutation by explaining why an idea doesn’t achieve its intended goal. Here’s a basic argument template for you to use:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>If the goal of this idea is [state the goal and context], then it doesn&#39;t work because [explain why].

<h5>Technique 3.3: Library of Reusable Refutations<a class="headerlink" href="#technique-3-3-library-of-reusable-refutations" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>You can also develop and maintain a library of common criticisms that refute lots of ideas very quickly. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Randomized Double Blind Experiments:</strong> <em>“The idea can’t work because it doesn’t pass a Randomized double blind placebo control (RDBPC) experiment.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contradictions with Modern Science:</strong> <em>“The idea contradicts [cosmology, physics, biology, continue to list].”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ad Hominem:</strong> <em>“This response is directed at the person but it doesn’t refute the idea that they’ve proposed.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Error-Correction Mechanisms:</strong> Refute an idea by demonstrating that it lacks mechanisms for identifying and correcting errors, which are crucial for refining and validating beliefs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Failure to Address Contradictory Evidence:</strong> Challenge an idea by showing that it fails to adequately address or explain evidence that contradicts its claims, indicating a lack of comprehensiveness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unfalsifiability:</strong> Challenge ideas that are structured in a way that they cannot be tested or falsified, as this shields them from critical scrutiny and makes them scientifically and logically unsound.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ignoring Alternative Explanations:</strong> Refute an idea by showing that it ignores plausible alternative explanations for the phenomena it attempts to explain, suggesting a lack of thoroughness in considering different perspectives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Circular Reasoning:</strong> Identifying arguments that assume the truth of what they are attempting to prove, thereby creating a logical loop that lacks independent validation.</p></li>

<h6>Debate Effectively<a class="headerlink" href="#debate-effectively" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h6>
<p>Elliot Temple’s approach to debating effectively centers around creating a structured, critical environment where ideas can be rigorously tested and refined. His recommendations, derived from the philosophy of Critical Fallibilism, provide a clear path for engaging in meaningful and productive debates. Here’s how you can use his recommendations:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Structure Your Debates:</strong> Begin by clearly presenting ideas before arguing about them. This separation helps clarify what is being discussed and sets a foundation for effective critique​. [6]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impasse Chains:</strong> Utilize impasse chains in debates, a method where participants can document where they agree to disagree if a resolution cannot be reached. This helps in understanding the exact points of contention and where the debate could not be resolved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Error Correction:</strong> Engage with mechanisms like the Paths Forward policy, which offers a generic framework for addressing disagreements when standard debate structures fail. This is particularly useful as a secondary failsafe to catch errors that might not be covered by the primary debate rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Public Engagement and Transparency:</strong> Address criticisms publicly rather than privately. This not only increases accountability but also enriches the debate by exposing ideas to a wider range of criticisms and perspectives. It’s important to document and respond to criticisms openly to foster a transparent intellectual environment​. [7]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Encourage Rational Debate Culture:</strong> Cultivate an attitude towards debate that values learning and improvement over winning. Recognize that losing a debate can be more educational than winning, as it provides opportunities to refine your ideas and correct errors​</p></li>

<div><p>“You took a chance. You did something great. You were wrong, but it was still great. You should feel great that it was great. You should feel like crap that it was wrong. […] I think that what you do and what I do matters.” - Dr. Gregory House</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You must take your ideas beyond the confines of your own mind and expose them to the harsh light of reality. Test them, challenge them, let them clash with the ideas of others. This is the crucible in which true knowledge is forged. Do not shrink from criticism or fear contradiction; embrace these as opportunities to refine your thoughts and strengthen your convictions. Reality is the ultimate arbiter of truth. If you find that your ideas withstand the rigorous tests of practical application and objective scrutiny, then you have earned the right to call them truths. Act on your ideas, for in action, they are either proven or dispelled. Stand firm in your pursuit of knowledge and never cower before the unknown; the world awaits the imprint of your reasoned, tested convictions.</p>

<h3>Analytics Techniques<a class="headerlink" href="#analytics-techniques" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Structured analytic techniques (SATs) are a set of tools used by analysts to improve the quality of their analysis and reduce the impact of cognitive biases and errors. SATs are based on the premise that humans are fallible and that our cognitive limitations can lead to errors in analysis. The goal of SATs is to provide a framework for analysis that minimizes the impact of these cognitive biases and errors.</p>
<div class="tip admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Why SATs Matter</p>
<p>In the art of cybersecurity, it is not the tools in our arsenal that define our mastery, but the clarity and depth of our thought. The true power of a cyber professional lies in understanding the intricacies beyond the screen, a skill more potent than any instrument. It is through structured analysis that one hones their craft and stands distinguished in the field.</p>
</div>
<section id="why-are-sats-important-in-cybersecurity">
<h4>Why are SATs important in cybersecurity?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-are-sats-important-in-cybersecurity" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>In the field of cybersecurity, Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs) serve as a critical set of tools to enhance the quality and reliability of analysis. These techniques are designed to counteract cognitive limitations and biases.</p>
<p>SATs assist analysts in systematically breaking down cybersecurity problems, ensuring that assumptions, biases, and established cognitive patterns are thoroughly scrutinized. This methodical approach to analysis helps in identifying subtle patterns and anomalies in data, situations or events.</p>
<p>By employing structured techniques, cybersecurity analysts can rigorously evaluate their hypotheses and conclusions, providing a more transparent and robust analysis. Moreover, SATs offer a balance between intuitive and methodical problem-solving, adding rigor to the analysis and making it easier to communicate and justify conclusions to stakeholders.</p>
<p>In an era where cybersecurity challenges are becoming increasingly intricate, the application of SATs is vital for ensuring that the underlying analysis driving cybersecurity strategies is as sound, comprehensive, and unbiased as possible.</p>

<h4>How you should choose a technique?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-you-should-choose-a-technique" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>Choosing the right technique in structured analytics is crucial to the success of any analysis. This decision can significantly influence the accuracy, relevance, and impact of your findings. Here are key factors to consider when selecting an analytical technique:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Understand the Objective:</strong> Begin by clearly defining the goal of your analysis. Are you trying to identify trends, predict future events, understand complex relationships, or solve a specific problem? The objective will guide you in choosing the most appropriate technique.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Know Your Audience:</strong> Tailor your technique to the needs and comprehension level of your audience. If your findings will be presented to non-technical stakeholders, choose methods that can be easily explained and visualized.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluate Resources and Constraints:</strong> Be realistic about the resources available, including time, expertise, and computational power. Some techniques might require more advanced skills or computing resources than others.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check for Relevance and Applicability:</strong> Ensure the technique aligns with the current industry standards and best practices. It should also be relevant to the specific field or sector of your analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flexibility and Scalability:</strong> Consider how adaptable the technique is to changes and how well it can scale with increased data or evolving requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Iterative Testing and Validation:</strong> Finally, remember that selecting a technique is not always a one-time decision. Be prepared to iteratively test different methods and validate their effectiveness in addressing your analysis objectives.</p></li>

<h4>Decompose and Visualize<a class="headerlink" href="#decompose-and-visualize" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The “Decompose and Visualize” approach in Structured Analytics Techniques is a method used for making sense of complex data. It involves breaking down large data sets into smaller parts to make them easier to understand. Once the data is broken down, it is then presented visually using charts, graphs, or maps. This makes it easier to see patterns and trends that might not be obvious in the raw data. In short, this technique helps in understanding complex data more clearly and making better decisions based on that data.</p>

<p>Problem solving is the most important skill to advance you technical cybersecurity competencies! You are only as good as the problems you can solve. Take this advice very seriously and become a master problem solver.</p>
</div>
<p>Problem solving in cybersecurity requires a combination of technical and non-technical skills. On the technical side, problem solvers must be able to understand and work with complex systems. They must also have a good understanding of security threats and how to defend against them. On the non-technical side, problem solvers must be able to communicate effectively with others and work well in team settings.</p>
<p>The ability to solve problems is critical to the success of any cybersecurity professional.</p>
<p>In this section, we offer some problem solving and structured analytics techniques you are encouraged to learn and master.</p>
<section id="problem-solving-techniques">
<h4>Problem Solving Techniques<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-solving-techniques" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>Problem solving is the process of identifying and resolving issues or obstacles that are preventing the attainment of a desired goal. In many cases, problem solving involves overcoming challenges or obstacles that are blocking the path to the goal, but it can also involve finding new and creative solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems. There are a variety of different approaches that can be taken when problem solving, and the most effective approach will vary depending on the specific problem that needs to be resolved. In some cases, a simple trial-and-error approach may be all that is needed to find a solution. However, for more complex problems, a more systematic approach may be necessary.</p>
<section id="simple-techniques">
<h5>Simple Techniques<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-techniques" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>

<section id="divide-and-conquer">
<h5>Divide and Conquer<a class="headerlink" href="#divide-and-conquer" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>This technique involves breaking down a large problem into smaller, more manageable parts, solving each part individually, and then combining them to solve the overall issue.</p>
<p>The following coding guidelines can be used to apply this technique in software engineering:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Limit Function Size:</strong> Aim to keep functions concise, ideally not exceeding 100 lines of code. This enhances readability and makes functions easier to understand and maintain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Single Responsibility Principle:</strong> Each function should perform a single task or responsibility. Avoid creating functions that handle multiple unrelated tasks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meaningful Names for Functions and Variables:</strong> Choose descriptive and meaningful names that clearly indicate the purpose of the function or the role of the variable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistent Coding Style:</strong> Adhere to a consistent coding style, including indentation, naming conventions, and file structure. This makes the codebase easier to navigate and maintain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Comments Sparingly and Effectively:</strong> Write comments to explain the ‘why’ behind complex logic, not the ‘how’. Avoid redundant comments for straightforward code segments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Refactoring:</strong> Regularly refactor code to improve efficiency and readability. This includes simplifying complex functions, removing redundant code, and optimizing algorithms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid Deep Nesting:</strong> Limit the depth of nesting (if/else, loops, etc.) within functions. Deeply nested code can be difficult to read and understand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limit Parameter Count:</strong> Aim to keep the number of parameters for a function to a minimum. If a function requires many parameters, consider using an object to encapsulate them.</p></li>

Subsequently, you gradually compose the function code required to pass your tests. You make small changes to the tests if you discover along the way that the functions do not follow the specifications you initially imagined. In this manner, you can verify that the entire body of your code operates as intended and be certain that every function you create operates as expected.</p>

<section id="the-polya-method">
<h5>The Pólya Method<a class="headerlink" href="#the-polya-method" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>George Pólya was a mathematician who proposed a general approach to problem solving that can be applied to software and cybersecurity problems.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Understand the problem</strong></p>
<p>In order to solve a problem, it is first necessary to understand what the problem is. This may seem obvious, but it is often overlooked. All too often, people try to solve a problem without first taking the time to fully understand it. This can lead to a lot of wasted effort and frustration. A good way to start understanding a problem is to ask some questions about it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do you understand all the terminology and parts of the problem?</p></li>
<li><p>What are we trying to achieve?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the data? e.g. error messages, input values etc.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the unknown?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any assumptions?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you have enough information to solve the problem?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Asking these kinds of questions can help to clarify the problem and make it easier to solve.</p>
<p>In order to understand the problem, it is important to consider all of the factors that may be involved. This includes looking at the situation from multiple perspectives and gathering as much information as possible. Once you have a good understanding of the problem, you can start to develop a plan to solve it. Keep in mind that there may be multiple ways to solve the problem, so it is important to explore all of the options and choose the one that is best suited for the situation.</p>
<div class="hint admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip!</p>
<p>Drawing figures and diagrams is usually helpful when trying to solve hard problems.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 2: Devise a plan</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways to devise a plan to solve a problem. One way is to brainstorm a list of possible solutions and then evaluate each one to see which is the best. Another way is to look at the problem from different perspectives and try to find a creative solution. Sometimes it helps to talk to others about the problem and get their input. Once a plan is devised, it is important to put it into action and see if it works. If not, it may be necessary to adjust the plan or come up with a new one.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Understand the goal</p></li>
<li><p>Look at other problems for inspiration (i.e., do you know a related problem?)</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a smaller part to try</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="hint admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip!</p>
<p>Ask yourself “What is the simplest, quickest, safest, cheapest, easiest and surest way to try solve the problem?”. Too often, people come up with over complicated plans and ideas!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 3: Carry out the plan</strong></p>
<p>There are many different ways to carry out a plan to solve a problem. The most important thing is to make sure that the plan is comprehensive and well thought out. Every step of the plan should be carefully considered, and each potential obstacle should be taken into account. The plan should be designed to solve the problem in the most efficient and effective way possible.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Focus on one part at a time</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly check with the goal</p></li>
<li><p>If something isn’t working, use that information to learn more about the problem, then try something else</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4: Look back</strong></p>
<p>When we look back after having solved a problem, we can see how far we’ve come and how much we’ve learned. We can also see what we could have done differently, and how we can improve in the future. This hindsight is valuable, and can help us to become better problem-solvers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be clear that you reached the goal</p></li>
<li><p>Find something you can learn</p></li>

<p>Root cause analysis (RCA) is a process used in IT to identify the underlying cause of a problem. By identifying the root cause, IT professionals can develop a solution that addresses the problem at its source, rather than simply treating the symptoms. Root cause analysis typically involves breaking down a problem into smaller pieces and then systematically investigating each piece to identify the root cause. This process can be used to identify problems with hardware, software, processes, or any other aspect of IT.</p>

<h4>When should I used a structured RCA technique?<a class="headerlink" href="#when-should-i-used-a-structured-rca-technique" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>There are two main approaches to problem solving: the intuitive approach and the structured approach. The intuitive approach is more flexible and relies on our natural ability to see patterns and relationships. The structured approach is more rigid and relies on a step-by-step process to find a solution. The intuitive approach is often quicker and can be more creative, but it can also be less reliable. The structured approach is usually slower, but it can be more reliable. Which approach is best depends on the problem at hand.</p>
<p>If you encounter an IT issue, such as a software bug, you should first try to resolve it intuitively. However, you should only try this for 20 minutes the first time. If you are unable to resolve the issue in this amount of time, you must switch to a structured approach. It may take 1-3 hours to address a challenging problem using a structured approach. Though these issues are uncommon, a truly challenging situation can take many days to solve. Asking the community for assistance is the next step if structured RCA doesn’t work.</p>

<h4>What are the steps in an RCA technique?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-steps-in-an-rca-technique" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The following diagram shows an overview of the root-cause analysis process:</p>
<img alt="RCA Process" class="grey-border mb-3" src="_images/rca-process.svg" /><ul class="simple">
<li><p><u>Step 1 - Develop an incident statement</u></p></li>
</ul>
<p>When troubleshooting an incident, it is important to first gather all of the relevant information in order to identify the root cause of the problem. This information can be gathered through an incident statement. An incident statement is simply a record of what happened, when it happened, and any relevant details that may help to identify the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple template for an incident statement:</p>
<img alt="Incident Statement Template" class="grey-border mb-3" src="_images/incident-statement-template.png" />
<p>Note that this methodology can be used to investigate a wide range of IT problems, including cyber intrusions.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><u>Step 2 - Identify all of the incident’s dimensions</u></p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many different dimensions to an incident. The most common dimensions are the who, what, when, where, why, and how. These dimensions can help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of an incident.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Dimension 1: Object affected</p></li>
<li><p>Dimension 2: Type of incident</p></li>
<li><p>Dimension 3: Users impacted</p></li>
<li><p>Dimension 4: Users location</p></li>
<li><p>Dimension 5: Incident location</p></li>
<li><p>Dimension 6: Time and date of the incident</p></li>
<li><p>Dimension 7: Pattern of occurrence</p></li>
<li><p>Dimension 8: Unique attributes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to add more dimensions. Every incident is unique so you should adapt the process to the problem you are facing.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how “dimensioning” an incident looks like:</p>
<img alt="Dimensioning an incident" class="grey-border mb-3" src="_images/incident-domains-examples.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><u>Step 3 - Generate hypotheses and test them</u></p></li>
</ul>
<p>When troubleshooting software, it is important to generate hypotheses and test them. This will help to identify the root cause of the problem and find a solution. One way to generate hypotheses is to brainstorm potential causes of the problem. Once you have a list of potential causes, you can then test each one to see if it is the actual cause of the problem. To test a hypothesis, you can try to reproduce the problem and see if the hypothesis is correct. If you are unable to find the root cause of the problem, it may be necessary to ask for help from others who are more experienced.</p>

<h4>Where can I go for help if RCA doesn’t work?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-can-i-go-for-help-if-rca-doesnt-work" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>We have found that RCA always succeeds. When it doesn’t, it’s because the practitioner didn’t use the technique correctly or didn’t fully comprehend the fault (i.e., it has not been properly dimensioned). In such cases, the following resources will prove helpful:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> A public platform to ask coding questions</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://serverfault.com/">Serverfault</a> A question and answer site for system and network administrators</p></li>

<p>There isn’t a single best way to learn. To find the approach that works best for you, you might need to test a few methods. In general, the following is what we advise:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>2 hours of practice per day, 4 days a week</p></li>
<li><p>An afternoon dedicated to working on a harder exercise or personal project</p></li>
<li><p>Reading a cybersecurity book an hour per day</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Set measurable goals<a class="headerlink" href="#set-measurable-goals" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>Setting goals for learning is an important part of the learning process. By setting goals, you can focus your efforts and stay motivated to achieve your goals. There are a few things to keep in mind when setting goals for learning. First, goals should be specific and measurable. Second, goals should be achievable and realistic. Third, goals should be time-bound, so that you know when you need to achieve them. setting goals for learning can help you to focus you efforts, stay motivated, and achieve you goals.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how to set a goal:</p>

<h4>Inspire others to join you<a class="headerlink" href="#inspire-others-to-join-you" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>When it comes to learning, one of the best things you can do is inspire others to join you. When you’re passionate about learning and growing, it’s contagious. Others will see your enthusiasm and be drawn to your example.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to inspire others to learn is simply by sharing what you’re learning with them. When you’re excited about a new concept or piece of information, share it with those around you. You never know who you might inspire to start learning themselves.</p>
<p>In addition to sharing what you’re learning, you can also encourage others to learn by asking them questions. When you’re curious about something, ask others around you if they know anything about it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Share your certificates on social media</p></li>
<li><p>Express gratitude towards those who help you</p></li>
<li><p>Be consistent, post twice a week</p></li>
